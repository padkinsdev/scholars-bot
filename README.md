Yet another Discord bot written with discord.js and used to handle reaction roles for the unofficial College Park Scholars Discord server I created.

### That's a nice profile picture. Did you draw it?
No. It's a [picrew](https://picrew.me/image_maker/19083), and credit goes to [etteokiii](https://twitter.com/etteokiii). Maybe someday I'll learn to draw, but for now I'm okay with being a greedy art-stealing goblin.

### Why does it work
I don't know. I just hit keys until the bot did what I wanted it to. It took a lot of blood, sweat, and tears (mostly tears).

### Why are there practically no comments in the code?
When I started making the bot, I was actually pretty diligent about explaining my code, but once I realized that I was going to be rewriting most of the code, I decided to prioritize having working code over having well-documented code.
